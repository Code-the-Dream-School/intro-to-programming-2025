## UPDATE: Scrimba has updated from version 1 to version 2 in May 2024.  Some of the screenshots below show you version 1 so you may see something different if you're using version 2.  Links for both versions (in case one is not loading properly etc) are below for the first several weeks

Students have access to [V1 Scrimba - https://scrimba.com/allcourses](https://v1.scrimba.com/allcourses) **(NOTE: The new version is: [V2 Scrimba - Courses](https://v2.scrimba.com/courses))** and all of their courses. Scrimba is an interactive learning platform where students can interact with the video content code editor.  You should be able to find the link to get free access to scrimba in your class announcements channel in Slack.

### Scrimba

The interface probably will look a little different than other video-based learning tools (e.g. Treehouse, Udemy, Khan Academy, etc.). Once logged in you can access the course library from the **Courses** link in the menu. 

**Version 1 looks like this:**

![Course Menu](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/intro-to-programming-2024/blob/cc6378bb314a0abf9ca3dc2304ed315d702c3b82/Screenshot%25202023-09-26%2520at%252011.07.37%2520AM.png?raw=true)

**Version 2 looks like this:**

The Scrimba Courses Library page will show all courses and you can filter by Topic and choose the course you want to look at. Each week, there will be links to specific course lesson material that will cover the topics for that week.

**Version 1 looks like this:**

### Scrimba Lesson Interface

In order to see a particular course’s lesson content you have to first “enroll” in the course. This involves clicking a start button.

**Version 1 looks like this:**

![Get Started Button](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/intro-to-programming-2024/blob/cc6378bb314a0abf9ca3dc2304ed315d702c3b82/Screenshot%25202023-09-26%2520at%252011.14.09%2520AM.png?raw=true)

**Version 2 looks like this:**

Afterward, a course menu will allow you to navigate to each lesson

**Version 1 looks like this:**

**In version 1**, you have to mouse over the course name and a pop-up menu will show each category of options.

**In version 2**, you click the name of the section you're on in the bottom left to go back to the course menu.

**You can _either_ use the written Odin Project lessons _or_ the video lessons in Scrimba.**. You can do both if you have them time and want to.

For the Odin Project, Go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page. If there are links you are redirected to as you read/work through the content, follow those links as well and read the content there too.

### Node

JavaScript, created by Brendan Eich, was initially designed to spruce up static web pages. Unlike many other programming languages that are versatile for building various types of software, JavaScript was tailor-made specifically for the web. Back in the day, if you wanted to use JavaScript, you had to create a website first.

Now, JavaScript has evolved significantly since its debut in the 1990s. It's become a full-fledged language, and you can even run it outside the confines of web browsers thanks to a nifty tool called Node.js, often just called Node. 

Node.js was cooked up by Ryan Dahl in 2009. With Node, you can run JavaScript projects on your computer and fine-tune your project's environment. It's like giving JavaScript more freedom to roam beyond just web pages.

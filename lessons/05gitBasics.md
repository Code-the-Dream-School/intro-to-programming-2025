# Get ready for git!

This week you'll be learning about git version control, and you'll start using a cloud-based git repository program called GitHub to complete your coding assignments.  There are several programs developers use as they build, test, and deploy/publish their code.  While you're welcome to use any tools/combination of tools you prefer, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Visual Studio Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  IDEs are helpful programs that combine several tools (a text editor, the command line/terminal, file organization, and more) into one program.  If you aren't currently using an IDE of your own preference, you should watch the video below and install Visual Studio Code and suggested extensions in the video before you start this week's assignment.

## _**STRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL): Intro to Algorithms**_
- **[Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/javascript-interview-challenges-c02c/~00) - JavaScript Interview Challenges**
- Watch and practice the first 5 videos (with solutions). Try to solve each algorithm before you watch the solution. The more you practice the more comfortable you will you get, which is good preparation for job interviewing.

### Algorithms

Think about it: you've been low-key using algorithms since your elementary school days. Yep, those step-by-step instructions for multiplying numbers? Bingo, those are algorithms!

Now, let's break it down a bit. An **algorithm** is like a super precise recipe for solving a computer puzzle. Simple, right? But wait, what's a **computational problem**? Well, it's basically a riddle that a computer can help us solve. For example, think about sorting a jumbled mess of numbers into a neat little order. That's a computational problem.

So, when we talk about problems, we're talking about spelling them out really clearly. That means telling the computer exactly what it's working with – the stuff going in, what's supposed to come out, and how they're all connected. This is similar to using AI as well. You have to write a very detailed prompt when communicating with AI or you may get missing or incorrect information back.

An algorithm is like a secret recipe that lays out a series of steps. If you stick to those steps exactly as they're written, voilà, you'll solve the problem! It's like having multiple paths to victory in a game – as long as you follow the rules, you'll win!

2. Read this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/).  We won’t be getting into the types of algorithms but it’s a good overview of how algorithms are part of a developer’s daily life.

You can either use the written Odin Project lessons or the video lessons in Scrimba.

Remember to please go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page. If there are links you are redirected to as you read/work through the content, follow those links as well and read the content there too.

- [The Odin Project â€“ Fundamentals Part 5](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-5)
  - You can skip the section on Intermediate/advanced array magic as we'll be looking at that next week!
- [V2 Scrimba - JS Deep Dive - Objects & Maps](https://v2.scrimba.com/javascript-deep-dive-c0a/~015)
- **NOTE: You do NOT have to watch the last three videos in this playlist ( (1) How Maps Can Do What Objects Can't, (2) Challenge: Your First Map, and (3) Improved Methods with Arrow Functions ). Those cover a topic that will NOT be covered in this lesson (i.e. Map).**

## NOTE ABOUT YOUR CODING ASSIGNMENT:
Remember that last week's and this week's assignments are in the same repl you forked last week.  You can return to that same repl by clicking on your profile in the top right of the replit site.  This should show your profile and a list of your "Public Repls".  Your Lesson 2 and 3 - Loops and Arrays repl should be listed in the "Public Repls".  Click on it to open it and continue working.  Remember to START at the Lesson 3 Objects heading which looks like this:

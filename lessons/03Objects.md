You can either use the written Odin Project lessons or the video lessons in Scrimba.

Remember to please go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page. If there are links you are redirected to as you read/work through the content, follow those links as well and read the content there too.

- [The Odin Project â€“ Fundamentals Part 5](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-5)
  - You can skip the section on Intermediate/advanced array magic as we'll be looking at that next week!
- [V2 Scrimba - JS Deep Dive - Objects & Maps](https://v2.scrimba.com/javascript-deep-dive-c0a/~015)
- **NOTE: You do NOT have to watch the last three videos in this playlist ( (1) How Maps Can Do What Objects Can't, (2) Challenge: Your First Map, and (3) Improved Methods with Arrow Functions ). Those cover a topic that will NOT be covered in this lesson (i.e. Map).**
  - **If you are getting an alert "Only available to subscribers" you need to use version 1 instead: [Version 1 - Deep Dive - Objects](https://v1.scrimba.com/learn/javascript/module-intro-objects-maps-cdNZ62Hv)  Remember to stop once you've completed Merge Objects with Object Spread**

## NOTE ABOUT YOUR CODING ASSIGNMENT:
During the beginning of class we switched from replit to codesandbox.  Because of this switch, we did not have to combine weeks 2 and 3 into one assignment.  Please click on the link to your coding assignment in the Coding Assignment section below, and proceed with completing all of the questions in that assignment.

You can either use the written Odin Project lessons or the video lessons in Scrimba.

- **NOTE: Watch only the first four videos in this playlist ( (1) Module Intro: Arrays, (2) Build Flexible Collections with Arrays, (3) Challenge: Your First Array, and (4) Check Element Existence in Arrays ). The rest of the topics we will cover in Week 5.**

The following material is an excerpt from The Odin Project – Fundamentals Part 4.  That section also covers Array Methods and Test Driven Development which will be covered later in this class. For convenience we've copied the Loop, Array, and Knowledge Check information from the Fundamentals Part 4 section below.

Remember to please go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page. If there are links you are redirected to as you read/work through the content, follow those links as well and read the content there too.

# **Loops**

Computers don’t get tired, and they’re really, *really* fast! For that reason, they are well suited to solving problems that involve doing calculations multiple times. In some cases, a computer will be able to repeat a task *thousands* or even *millions* of times in just a few short seconds where it might take a human many hours. (Obviously, speed here depends on the complexity of the calculation and the speed of the computer itself). One way to make a computer do a repetitive task is using a **loop**.

1. Read this [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code). It’s a longer one, but make sure you tackle the ‘Active Learning’ sections at the bottom of the page.
2. Once again, same info, slightly different context from [JavaScript.info](http://javascript.info/while-for). (Skim the info if you think you know it all, but **don’t forget the tasks at the end of the page**. You learn best by *doing*.)

# **Arrays**

Strings and numbers may be our building blocks, but as your scripts get more complex, you’re going to need a way to deal with large quantities of them. Luckily, JavaScript has a couple of data types that are used for just that. An Array is simply an ordered collection of items (Strings, numbers, or other things).

1. [This tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) is a great introduction.
2. [This article](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp) covers some of the most useful built-in array methods. These fundamentals are something you’ll use every day, so don’t rush too much and miss out!
3. [Web Dev Simplified video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W4pQQ20nJg) explains an overview of arrays in JavaScript in about 6 minutes.

### Getting Deeper into Git (OPTIONAL)

Read through the first two links which help explain git branching and merges, the workflow you'll be using throughout class.  Then watch the video which helps demonstrate that workflow from the context of team development (multiple people working on the same code base).  Finally, complete the Coursera course.

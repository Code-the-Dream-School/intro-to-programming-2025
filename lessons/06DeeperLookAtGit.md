### Getting Deeper into Git

Read through the first two links which help explain git branching and merges, the workflow you'll be using throughout class.  Then watch the video which helps demonstrate that workflow from the context of team development (multiple people working on the same code base).  Finally, complete the Coursera course.

### If you did not start/opt to work on last week's stretch goal of learning about Algorithms, you can start look into this week!  If you did start (or even finish it!) feel free to continue practicing with algorithms after your deeper look at git this week.  Here is the content from last week's lesson copied to this week's lesson so you do not have to switch back and forth: 

## _**STRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL): Intro to Algorithms**_
- **[Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/javascript-interview-challenges-c02c/~00) - JavaScript Interview Challenges**
- Watch and practice the first 5 videos (with solutions). Try to solve each algorithm before you watch the solution. The more you practice the more comfortable you will you get, which is good preparation for job interviewing.

### Algorithms

Think about it: you've been low-key using algorithms since your elementary school days. Yep, those step-by-step instructions for multiplying numbers? Bingo, those are algorithms!

Now, let's break it down a bit. An **algorithm** is like a super precise recipe for solving a computer puzzle. Simple, right? But wait, what's a **computational problem**? Well, it's basically a riddle that a computer can help us solve. For example, think about sorting a jumbled mess of numbers into a neat little order. That's a computational problem.

So, when we talk about problems, we're talking about spelling them out really clearly. That means telling the computer exactly what it's working with – the stuff going in, what's supposed to come out, and how they're all connected. This is similar to using AI as well. You have to write a very detailed prompt when communicating with AI or you may get missing or incorrect information back.

An algorithm is like a secret recipe that lays out a series of steps. If you stick to those steps exactly as they're written, voilà, you'll solve the problem! It's like having multiple paths to victory in a game – as long as you follow the rules, you'll win!

1. Read this [article](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-a-very-brief-intro-to-cs) on Odin. 
2. Read this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/).  We won’t be getting into the types of algorithms but it’s a good overview of how algorithms are part of a developer’s daily life. 
3. Once again, same info, but [a video](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/v/what-are-algorithms) from Khan Academy.

_**While there is no stretch goal assignment associated with this stretch goal lesson material, you can always search for algorithm problem practice and/or keep working with and practicing the Interview Challenges from Scrimba at the top of this section.**_

### Getting Deeper into Git

Read through the first two links which help explain git branching and merges, the workflow you'll be using throughout class.  Then watch the video which helps demonstrate that workflow from the context of team development (multiple people working on the same code base).  Finally, take a look at the Coursera course with "Module 4 - Collaboration" being your primary focus.  You do not need to complete the full course, but you're welcome to look at it at your convenience throughout the remainder of the class.

Originally we also suggested the following Coursera course:
* [Coursera: git - GitHub introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) (a free full course on it that covers a lot more)

**HOWEVER** this Coursera lesson can only be accessed with a free 7-day trial.  You would have to provide a credit card number **_and remember to cancel your free trial before the end of the 7 days in order to not be charged._**  If you think you would be able to afford and would want to take other Coursera courses, feel free to use this tool.

**ALTERNATIVELY**
These documents and videos are directly from git and GitHub on how to understand and use git version control and GitHub.  Please refer to these to assist in your learning about git and GitHub this week:

 * [Reference manual and Introduction Videos - sourced from git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
 * [git Basics - sourced from GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics)
 * [Using git - sourced from GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git)

### If you did not start/opt to work on last week's stretch goal of learning about Algorithms, you can start look into this week!  If you did start (or even finish it!) feel free to continue practicing with algorithms after your deeper look at git this week.  Here is the content from last week's lesson copied to this week's lesson so you do not have to switch back and forth: 

## _**STRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL): Intro to Algorithms**_
- **[Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/javascript-interview-challenges-c02c/~00) - JavaScript Interview Challenges**
- Watch and practice the first 5 videos (with solutions). Try to solve each algorithm before you watch the solution. The more you practice the more comfortable you will you get, which is good preparation for job interviewing.

### Algorithms

Think about it: you've been low-key using algorithms since your elementary school days. Yep, those step-by-step instructions for multiplying numbers? Bingo, those are algorithms!

Now, let's break it down a bit. An **algorithm** is like a super precise recipe for solving a computer puzzle. Simple, right? But wait, what's a **computational problem**? Well, it's basically a riddle that a computer can help us solve. For example, think about sorting a jumbled mess of numbers into a neat little order. That's a computational problem.

So, when we talk about problems, we're talking about spelling them out really clearly. That means telling the computer exactly what it's working with – the stuff going in, what's supposed to come out, and how they're all connected. This is similar to using AI as well. You have to write a very detailed prompt when communicating with AI or you may get missing or incorrect information back.

An algorithm is like a secret recipe that lays out a series of steps. If you stick to those steps exactly as they're written, voilà, you'll solve the problem! It's like having multiple paths to victory in a game – as long as you follow the rules, you'll win!

2. Read this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/).  We won’t be getting into the types of algorithms but it’s a good overview of how algorithms are part of a developer’s daily life. 
3. Once again, same info, but [a video](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/v/what-are-algorithms) from Khan Academy.

_**You can always search for algorithm problem practice and/or keep working with and practicing the Interview Challenges from Scrimba at the top of this section.  If you didn't complete the practice exercises at the bottom of your Lesson 4 replit you can revisit those too!**_

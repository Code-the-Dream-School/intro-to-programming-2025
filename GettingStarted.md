# Welcome International Coders!

Thank you for your interest in our program. Since we aren't able to accommodate international students, we can at least offer our curriculum to anyone who wants to self-study!

This repository contains all the lesson and coding assignment information we currently offer in our Intro to Programming JavaScript class.  Please use the table below to work through the 15 weeks of course content.  Look at your lesson materials first, then attempt the coding assignment.  Scrimba (a lesson material we recommend) does require a paid subscription to their pro content), if you aren't able to afford it, we recommend sticking to using the Odin Project resources we share as they are free and open-source, and use the free Scrimba lessons where available. 

Since you don't have the time constraints of a course with our program, feel free to spend multiple weeks on concepts that are challenging for you or work through several weeks in a shorter period of time.  We particularly recommend spending a couple weeks extra on the first four lessons, especially if you are new to JavaScript.  Happy learning!

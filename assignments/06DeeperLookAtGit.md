You have been working hard this class.  Now it's time to have a little fun!  Since you started learning about git version control last week, and learned a bit more about it this week, we want you to download and play the "Oh My Git!" game.  To start, follow <a href="https://blinry.itch.io/oh-my-git" target="_blank">this link</a> to the game download instructions.  

Please read the "Play on ___?" information for your operating system as you may need to do a little extra work to get the game running after you've downloaded it.  Once you've read that information, in the Download section below it, click the red Download button for the operating system you use.  

If downloading isn't working out for you, or you just want a different game to play with this week to practice using git, check this <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US" target="_blank">Learn Git Branching</a> site out!

There is no coding assignment to work on or turn in this week so please enter "no code this week" in the 'URL' field of your assignment submission form and use the 'Questions' field to share your thoughts on either or both of these games!

**REMINDER**

If you are completing work on the Algorithms Stretch Goal this lesson, you should go to your "Lesson 5 - STRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL): Intro to Algorithms" of your Lesson Materials and work on the Scrimba - JavaScript Interview Challenges linked in that section.

### Final Project Submission Details

Final week!  

This week you'll finish any work on your Portfolio and Open API projects.  Be sure you've merged any open pull requests to the main branches for both of your projects when your work is completed and before you submit.  When you submit your projects, you'll use your usual Assignment Submission process (the button at the bottom of your lesson page) and put your portfolio repository link in the "Link to your Coding Assignment / Pull Request / Final Project Repository" field.  
It should look like `https://github.com/yourUsername/yourRepositoryName`.  
Use the "Link to your SECOND Coding Assignment / Pull Request / Final Project Repository" field to submit your Open API project.  
It should look like `https://github.com/yourUsername/yourOpenAPIProjectName`.  
The form will have new questions on it regarding what you would like to do next with our program.

As long as your final projects meet rubric requirements and you've taken/passed your assessment (which was emailed to you at the start of this lesson week) you will advance to the next course of your choosing.

### Project Demo Details

It is good practice to talk about what you have learned and know about project as you will be asked to talk about your experiences in job interviews.  This is why we ask all students to give a short demo of their final projects.  This demo is NOT graded and your performance in the demo will have no bearing on your graduation.  Please record a 3-5 minute presentation that touches on all of the following:
 - [ ] Scroll the length of your portfolio to show your format and styling of your content
 - [ ] Demonstrate your form section by entering one or two user entries and showing if/how entries can be edited or deleted
 - [ ] Enter Inspector/Developer Mode to demonstrate how your portfolio looks on different device sizes
 - [ ] Scroll the length of your Open API project to show your format and styling of your content
 - [ ] Demonstrate your navigation to show that both required endpoints are displaying to the user
 - [ ] Enter Inspector/Developer Mode to demonstrate how your API project looks on different device sizes
 - [ ] Share what the most challenging part of either/both projects and what you enjoyed working on the most in either/both projects

Rubric details for the Portfolio Project and the Open API Project can be seen below.  Be sure both your projects meet the requirements specified for each.

### How to record your presentation
You can record your presentation in any of these three ways: 
 1. Logging into your personal Zoom account and record your personal meeting where only you are in attendance and you are screensharing your work ([this is a link to a video on how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njwbjFYCbGU))
 2. Use a screen recording program already on your machine
    * [Mac users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Byefp51tY)
    * [Windows users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJB7pM5bvNI)
 4. Use an online option such as loom ([link to a how to video on loom here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAdLPbfXcQo)).

 - [ ] Remember to use alt for any images so there will be helper text if the image is not displayed properly

#### Styling
Everyone's style is different and we encourage students to let the style fo their site represent them.  That being said, there are some general style guidelines we encourage you to follow:
 - [ ] Remember to have appropriate contrast to your site (don't use a dark font on a dark background
 - [ ] You should not need to horizontally scroll to see your site content on any device (mobile, tablet, or desktop)
 - [ ] Watch out for font sizes on smaller devices.  The screen is smaller, but the font size should not be small also.  This is also true for form input fields/buttons, a user would need to tap on it with a finger to get focus on the input to type, don't make it too small that their device can't recognize what they're trying to tap on.

## Open API Project
<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the Open API Project rubric</summary>
<br>
Use one of the following open source APIs to create a site that accesses a minimum of 2 endpoints.  (Example: if using the weather app, you could display (1) the temperature and (2) the weather condition).  

### Open Source API options:
* [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) – a weather API
* [Swapi.Tech](https://www.swapi.tech/) – an API about Star Wars films
* [Marvel](https://developer.marvel.com/) – an API about the Marvel fandom
* [ARTIC](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) – an art API from the Art Institute of Chicago
* [TheDogAPI](https://thedogapi.com/) or the [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) – APIs about (you guessed it!) Dogs or Cats
* [Soccer](https://api-sports.io/documentation/football/v3) - for all the Soccer lovers out there
* DEPRECATED, certificate expired - [SampleAPIs](https://sampleapis.com/api-list/coffee) – an API for coffee lovers

Be sure to satisfy the below requirements in your Open API Project:

### STRUCTURE:
 - [ ] A public GitHub repository containing your project
 - [ ] An HTML document for the page
 - [ ] A CSS document to style the HTML page
 - [ ] A JavaScript file that retrieves data from one of several public API sources to display the data on your HTML page
 - [ ] A README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage (This does not need to be a live site; you can instruct the user to download and run locally)

### CONTENT:
 - [ ] Display the data for at least 2 endpoints in the API
 - [ ] Include navigation from each endpoint’s page to the other (Example: if using the weather app, one navigation link should display the temperature details and the second navigation link should display the weather condition)
 - [ ] Issue new GET requests each time the user click a navigation link, meaning you should have 2 GET requests - one for each navigation, that requests only the needed information (Example: if using the weather app, clicking temperature navigation link should pull only data that allows user to see temperatures and clicking conditions navigation link should pull only data that allows user to see weather conditions)

### FUNCTIONALITY:
 - [ ] Code runs without issues by following the instructions in the README file
 - [ ] Navigation between the different endpoints behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed (this is the reason for the 2 separate GET requests)
 - [ ] Code is readable and well structured
 - [ ] If applicable, error cases are appropriately handled
 - [ ] Styling is effective (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)
